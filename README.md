# Syllable Classifier: Using supervised Machine Learning to predict whether a syllable is Gurung or Nepali

## Abstract
This project uses data from my doctoral dissertation (Ronkos 2020) to see whether a supervised Machine Learning model can be trained to correctly classify syllables as belonging to one of two languages -- Gurung, a Tibeto-Burman minority language of Nepal, or Nepali, an Indo-Aryan language that is the official langauge of Nepal. The data is coded differently for consonants and vowels; consonants are described using categorical features since the methods of acoustically measruing consonants vary greatly depending on the type of consonant (i.e. voice onset time for obstruents but formants for sonorants), while vowels are coded using acoustic data extracted from recorded soundfiles using the open source software Praat (Boersema & Weenik 2022). The soundfiles were recorded with the help of 5 speakers of Gurung and 5 speakers of Nepali using a Sennheiser ME66 microphone and a Zoom H4N recorder, and together comprise a fairly balanced dataset of 5,099 syllables (2,313 Gurung syllables and 2,786 Nepali syllables). Using Scikit Learn, I fit a baseline logistic regression model to see if it would perform better than chance. This initial model had an acccracy of 0.767. After some attempts at additional feature engineering did not increase performance, I ultimately fit a Stacking Ensemble model that combined K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression models to achieve an accuracy of 0.91. This suggests that coding syllables using the features linguistis have determined are useful in human speech perception may also be useful in machine learning classification of speech. Ths has applications in automatic speech recognition, accent or language detection, or other circumstances where it my be useful to detect a novel speaker's language using only syllable information rather than pretraining on entire words or lexicons.

## Data
The data for this project comes from wordlists of ~92 words recorded with the help of 5 speakers of Gurung and 5 speakers of Nepali. Each speaker was recorded saying each word three times each in isolation. The recordings were made using a Sennheiser ME66 microphone and a Zoom H4N recorder. The elicitation sessions took place in 2017 in New York City, as well as Sikles Village and Kathmandu, Nepal. 
Each recording was processed using Praat (Boersema & Weenik 2022), an open source software for phonetic and acoustic analysis commonly used in linguistics that allows the easy measurement of waveforms and generation of spectrograms, and the boundaries of the vowels in each word were hand-coded. A Praat Script by Stanley & Lipani was used to automatically extract measruements in Hertz for the first formant (F1), second formant (F2), third formant (F3), and measureements for the duration in milliseconds for each vowel in each word. Additionally, vowel nasalization (a contrastive feature in both languages) was coded categorically (nasal or not nasal).
The consonants were coded categorically so they could be compared across all words -- onset consonants were coded for manner of articulation (limited to labial, coronal, dorsal, or none), place of articulation (limited to obstruent, sonorant, or none), and laryngeal state (a way of accounting for both breathy phonation and aspiration phonetically present in both languages but phonologically encoded differently in each language). Coda consonants were simply coded as present or absent (mapping to open or closed syllables). Although I did not realize it at the time, the choices I made in encoding the consonant data were essentially preemptive feature engineering. Rather that coding for all 8 manners of articulation across both langauges (stop, fricative, affricate, nasal, trill, lateral fricative, lateral approximant, approximant), I condensed them into the two larger natural classes of obstruent and sonorant. Rather than coding for all 7 places of articulation across both languages (bilabial, dental, alveolar, retroflex, palatal, velar, glottal), I condensed them into three larger natural classes or labial, coronal, and dorsal. I also chose not to encode any place or manner features for the coda consonants, as I suspected that merely knowing whether a syllable was open (no coda consonant) or closed (coda consonant) would be the most useful for the model.
